Here are the Guidelines you need to follow as a maintainer

## Guidelines for Maintainers 

1. Must follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/NIT-dgp/Guidelines/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) of NIT Dgp Open Source
2. Should be online regularly in the [NIT-dgp/general](https://gitter.im/NIT-dgp/General) gitter channel
3. Must be associated with at least one project team
4. Carry out the Tasks and events assigned to you voluntarily

### Tasks and events

1. **Monthly releases of softwares**
   
    We want to follow a monthly release schedule for each of the active repositories in our org. It is important to keep the project active and keep the community growing. Just think of a new feature and bug fixes for each month and make a task list in a wiki page of the repo named like **Todo - May 2017 Release**. Try to accomplish it by the end of the month and do a new release for the project with the features incorporated.
2. **Conduct monthly online meetups**

    Online meetups and discussions are a great form of interaction in a open source community. You don't have to meet physically to discuss some new stuff. An online call is a great way to discuss things or plan something. Discussions can vary around from organizing events or discuss a new topic you have learnt to others.

    Schedule a online meetup every month. Fix up a regular schedule, preferably a specific date in each month (like 5th or 25th of each Month) so that it everyone remembers it. One member must be a host who starts the discussion and takes the responsibility of setting the topic and communicating the meetup link in the mailing list and chat channel. Its better everyone alternately hosts the meetup in each month so that everyone gets the experience.  
3. **Conduct Hackathons and workshops**

    Hackathons and workshops are the best way to keep new people coming to open source. New ideas come up that can in fact turn into new projects that can keep growing througout the times.
